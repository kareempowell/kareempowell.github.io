						<h1 class="my-3">U.S. College Hunger Games: The International Student Experience!</h1>
						<div class="content text-left">
							<hr>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>"We’re excited to share that you’ve been awarded a scholarship to study a Master’s in Financial Engineering in Los Angeles, California!"</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Wow, great! But also—yikes. I was thrilled, but it also felt extremely sudden. I had just applied in January of 2022, and now, in just six months, I’d be packing up to leave home. My head spun with a thousand questions: Was I ready for the move? What were my next steps? How should I prepare? Up till then, my perception of the international student experience in the U.S. closely resembled that of a real-life Hunger Games: where students from different "districts" competed for limited opportunities.</p>
					              	<h3></h3>              
					              	<p>Would reality live up to that expectation?</p>
							<h2>The U.S. College Experience</h2>
							<p>My journey as an international student started long before I set foot in the U.S. Leading up to my departure, I reached out to international students and alumni to hear about their experiences moving, studying, and tackling the U.S. job market. In August 2022, I left home — from Jamaica — traveling to California, ready to start classes. Settling in was actually easier than expected—a few Amazon orders and I was good to go. Classes kicked off, and to my surprise, studying abroad felt easier compared with back home. Courses like Corporate Finance and Introduction to Risk Management focused less on theories and more on real-world applications.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In Risk Management, for instance, we built real-time risk assessment models, analyzing companies' financials using 10-Qs and 10-Ks. Corporate valuations were no longer abstract theories, as we applied learned methods to real, local companies. Another key difference was the emphasis placed by lecturers on being familiar with global financial markets:"What’s the current price of the Dow Jones Index?" Ms Porter often asked. Back home, academic success was king! As the better your grades, the better your job prospects. But here, things were different, and conversations with alum seemed to echo the same:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>"In grad school grades don't really matter. What matters is how you apply what you learn."</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But that wasn’t completely true for international students. For us, grades did matter. Failing a course meant retaking it—expensive. And poor academic performance could cost you your scholarship—which was even more expensive! So, it became clear: I would have to be exceptional both in-and-outside of the classroom. Good grades would not be enough to land me the job, unless I attended an Ivy of course! Well, actually—maybe not? </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/01/15/when-harvard-mbas-cant-find-jobs-how-the-job-market-has-changed/">“Harvard MBA graduates struggle to find jobs.”</a>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>The result? <b>A historic 20-game winning streak,</b> the longest in MLB history. The A’s didn’t win the World Series, but the impact of <em>MoneyBall</em> was undeniable. A year later, the Boston Red Sox adopted a similar statistical approach and went on to <b>win their first championship in 86 years!</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>The <em>MoneyBall</em> revolution had already begun.</p>
							<h2>Could MoneyBall Work in Football?</h2>
							<p>Baseball is a numbers-heavy sport, making it ideal for statistical optimization. Football, on the other hand, is more fluid, with complex player interactions. But does that mean a MoneyBall-style approach would not work? Not necessarily.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Consider <b>Sevilla FC,</b> the most successful club in <b>Europa League history (7 titles)</b>. Yet, as of March 4, 2025, Sevilla sits <b>12th in La Liga</b>&mdash;far from their former glory. Post-COVID financial struggles, coupled with <b>La Liga’s strict Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules,</b> have <b>severely limited the club's spending power.</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>So, what if Sevilla applied MoneyBall principles, to identify undervalued players through advanced statistical models, and to rebuild their squad while staying within financial constraints?</p>
							<h2>Finding Hidden Gems: The Borussia Dortmund Model</h2>
							<p>Dortmund’s approach? Identify undervalued talent early, use analytics to predict their peak performance, and sell at the perfect time.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Unlike Dortmund, Leicester wasn’t known for shrewd player sales. But they <b>got it right leading up to the 2016 season,</b> using data to build a title-winning squad on what you could call a <b>shoestring budget.</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>With the <b>17th lowest wage bill in the league (£38M)</b>, Leicester somehow outperformed <b>big-spending clubs like Chelsea FC (£104M).</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>How? <b>Smart scouting and injury prevention.</b> They signed overlooked players like <b>N’Golo Kanté,</b> whose <b>elite interception stats</b> made him the perfect fit for the physically demanding Premier League. Purchased for <b>€9M</b>, Kanté became a key part of Leicester’s title run before being sold for <b>€35.8M—a 398% return.</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But the club also used a <b>data-driven fitness tracking approach</b> to minimize injuries, ensuring their best XI stayed on the pitch. The result? A historic title win that defied all logic. Except the logic of statistics!</p>
							<h2>Other Applications of MoneyBall?</h2>
							<p>Imagine the application of similar principles in basketball. The <b>Los Angeles Lakers</b>, for example, are chasing their <b>18th NBA championship</b>, led by <b>LeBron James and Luka Dončić.</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Could a <em>MoneyBall</em>-style statistical approach identify the missing pieces needed to <b>secure the Los Angeles Laker another ring?</b> Maybe that’s already been done, and, if so, then this might be the year that <b>LeBron "The Goat" James</b> claims his fifth and potentially final NBA championship.</p>
							<h2>MoneyBall is Really Value-a-Ball!</h2>
							<p>At its core, MoneyBall is about <b>maximizing value.</b> The same applies in sports, business, or investing&mdash;success comes from <b>finding hidden opportunities, making data-driven decisions, and identifying undervalued assets,</b> before the market catches on.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>So, who will be the next team to rewrite history with MoneyBall? Time will definitely tell!</p>
