							<h3></h3>
							<p>Who made the first apple pie? Where was it created? Gosh, I don’t know! But you know who might, Lauren Cabral from <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">BackThenHistory</a>. Here’s this:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>“Like apples, apple pie isn’t nearly as American as you might think. In fact, apple pie originated in Europe and it was developed with the help of multiple culinary influences, including cuisine from Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>An anonymous <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">Due South writer</a> also mentions:  “The earliest recorded recipe for apple pie dates to 1381, found in a cookbook titled The Forme of Cury, which was compiled by the master cooks of King Richard II.” </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>You mean to tell me that apple pie recipes originated from the cookbook of a king? I mean it <em>fits</em> right? Back in <em>those</em> days, sweet and savory <em>seemed only fit</em> for the rich. But who <em>really</em> cares where apple pies came from? What we do know is that this sweet and savory dish — a simple puree of apples, mixed with sugar, flour and other ingredients — is one of the most popular delicacies you’ll taste today. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Nowadays, the <em>great</em> pie makers, such as Julian Pie Company and The Pie Hole, provide ready-to-eat options for individuals such as myself, who can’t be bothered to bake pies from scratch. Now, I may not be the best baker, but I’m most certainly a great coder — so join me on this journey as we create an algorithmic trading model, using an apple pies approach; at the newly established <b>Powell's Pies!</b> </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Where To Start?</h2>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>To create our version of this popular <em>delicacy</em> (born from elites and mastered only by a few) we’ll combine financial apple instruments, sugar correlation and statistical flour packages, and mix these ingredients into our integrated development environment (IDE) bowl. After, we’ll bake our mixture using our application programming interface oven to serve on the world’s markets – hopefully yielding some yummy profitable results.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Being fairly new to the business, we’ll start with what’s needed to set up shop. We’ll choose Pycharm for our IDE bowl and the Interactive Brokers’ Web API for our API oven. An IDE is where we’ll run our code, while the API is a software tool that allows us to connect to live financial data from our brokerage or trading account.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Now that we have the necessary tools, let’s start with a basic recipe. We’ll combine currencies, indices and bitcoin ingredients with statistical flour momentum packages, mixing these together in our API bowl. Once we get the recipe correct, we’re now guaranteed to establish Powell’s Pies as the leading pie maker! Right? No, not so much. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Pie markets are extremely volatile. There are tons of pies and tons of pie makers, which makes it extremely difficult to compete. Powell’s Pies will also be competing with experienced pie makers who live and die by their pies, such as J Pie Morgan, MorgPie Stanley and GoldPie Stacks.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But, let’s say Powell’s Pies received $100,000 to create our delicious creations. Could we now compete? Just maybe. But, let's look at an how a neighboring pie business, Samy’s Pies competes:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>A neighboring pie store, Samy’s Pies, sells pies throughout the year. However, the owner Samy sees most of her revenue in the holiday seasons. Samy benefits from selling holiday themed pies that exploits uncaptured segments of the larger pie market. Samy also has different methods of combining ingredients depending on  the season. For example, Samy sells apple peach pies in the Spring, and green apple pies leading up to St. Patrick Day.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>When constructing algorithmic trading models a similar intuition applies. Competing with larger firms often requires an out of the box approach, that capitalizes on “missed opportunities” or uncaptured market segments similar to when running a newly established pie shop. Using the capital you have to find <em>these missed opportunities</em> sounds like Business 101 to me! </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From Matt Levine’s Bloomberg newsletter, “The SEC Was Busy Last Week” here’s this:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Most people have 60/40 portfolios, where they put 60% of their money in stocks and 40% in bonds.</li>
								<li>If stocks go up by 2% and bonds go down by 2%, then your 60/40 portfolio becomes a 61/39 portfolio.</li>
								<li>Therefore you have to sell some stocks and buy some bonds to get back to 60/40.</li>
								<li>When you sell stocks, stocks will go down; when you buy bonds, bonds will go up. …</li>
							</ol>
							<p>… If this were true, you might try to profit from it. “Whenever a 60/40 investor is going to buy stocks tomorrow, I will buy them today, and then sell them tomorrow when they go up, and vice versa,” is the basic idea.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>… You could do better — and maybe save 8 basis points — but at some cost in time and attention and internal processes, and you could also do worse. Why bother? Let someone else do it. Let some hedge fund that is set up to think about this stuff make the 8 basis points.”” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/the-sec-was-busy-last-week" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>That is certainly one way to earn from selling pies — sell pies directly to pie companies who may not have enough pies to meet demand at certain times of the month. Sounds a bit exploitative, but no not really. All’s fair in the world of business. Well, actually not. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From Matt Levine’s newsletter referenced above, he discusses the SEC’s enforcement case against the quantitative hedge fund firm, Two Sigma, who tried to make pie profits from <em>allegedly deceiving</em> their customers. The case goes a little something like this: </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Two Sigma Researchers <em>“allegedly”</em> tricked the company’s algorithmic trading model into prioritizing two researchers’ signals to improve the firm’s overall performance to increase those researchers’ respective pay. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Hedge funds pay researchers to find trading signals — ingredients that make their pies taste better — that are then fed into an IDE bowl that determines which ingredients to use. The choice of ingredients may depend on several factors, including the day of the week or if Trump made a tweet that inflated the price of the U.S. dollar, say at the expense of the S&P 500. In that case, the IDE bowl may have been automated to choose ingredients comprising U.S. dollar currencies, as opposed to the S&P 500 to benefit from the price hike. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But, Two Sigma’s IDE bowl also took into account the correlation sugar between different trading signals. Correlation can be described as “a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other”. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp" target="_blank">[2]</a> When financial instruments are affected by similar factors we say that there is a higher correlation. When instruments are not affected by similar factors, we in turn say that the correlation is low. In our case, correlation sugar aims to extract the collective sweetness of all of our ingredients allowing each to contribute just marginally to overall pie’s sweetness; as too much correlation can result in an incredibly sweet and unhealthy pie. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>To prioritize their ingredients, two Two Sigma researchers tricked the model to increase the overall portfolio correlation causing funds to overperform by more than $400 million, and underperform by close to $165 million. But why is this a bad thing? Didn’t Two Sigma make a net profit of $235 million? Didn’t adding more sugar make the pot sweeter? Well, the pot was simply too sweet! While Two Sigma certainly made a net profit, they did so at the expense of investors in one of their funds— the fund that underperformed by $165 million! While the pot was certainly sweeter, some of their investors bore majority effect. In arbitrations with the SEC, Two Sigma were forced to pay $165 million to investors in the underperforming fund, and another $90 million to the SEC, for a cease-and-desist order. That brings the total loss of sweetening the pot to $20 million!  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-15" target="_blank">[3]</a> Seems <em>kinda</em> bad to me.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In creating quantitative trading strategies, too much correlation <em>is a bad thing</em>. However, reducing the measured correlation, to make it seem like there is less correlation, <em>is a really bad thing!</em></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From this example, one thing holds clear — it matters, the weighting of our algorithmic ingredients. Creating a portfolio with low correlated ingredients and strategies leads to optimal risk adjusted returns. <a href="https://www.alliancebernstein.com/cmsobjectabd/pdf/investoreducation/r25281_lowcorrelation.pdf" target="_blank">[4]</a> But maybe just maybe, sweetening the pot will propel Powell’s pies to never before seen stardom, as the number 1 pie maker on the world’s pie markets! Well, actually, no, that’s not how it works. If we, Powell’s Pies, agreed to sell pies with this level of sugar, but lied as to how much sugar we were actually selling, we’d <em>probably</em> be shut down by the PIE-SEC.</p>
