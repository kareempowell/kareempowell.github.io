							<h3></h3>
							<p>Who invented the first apple pie? Where did it come from? Honestly, I have no idea! But you know who might? Lauren Cabral from <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">BackThenHistory</a>. Here’s what she says:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>“Like apples, apple pie isn’t nearly as American as you might think. In fact, apple pie originated in Europe and was shaped by multiple culinary influences, including those from Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>An anonymous <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">Due South writer</a> also notes: “The earliest recorded recipe for apple pie dates back to 1381, found in a cookbook titled <em>The Forme of Cury</em>, compiled by the master cooks of King Richard II.” </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>So, you’re telling me apple pie recipes originated in a royal cookbook? Makes sense, right? Back in those days, sweet and savory treats were mostly reserved for the wealthy. But does it really matter where apple pie came from? What we do know is that this timeless dessert—a simple blend of apples, sugar, flour, and spices—remains one of the most beloved treats today.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Nowadays, top-tier pie makers like <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">Julian Pie Company</a> and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32859-d15218532-Reviews-The_Pie_Hole-Pasadena_California.html" target="_blank">The Pie Hole</a> offer ready-made options for people like me—who would rather not bake from scratch. While I may not be the best baker, I am a great coder. So, join me on this journey as we develop an algorithmic trading model using an “apple pie” approach at the newly established <b>Powell’s Pies!</b></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Where to Start?</h2>
							<p>To create our version of this beloved delicacy—once reserved for elites and now mastered by only a few—we’ll blend financial “apple” instruments, sugar correlation, and statistical “flour” packages. Then, we’ll mix these ingredients in our integrated development environment (IDE) bowl and bake them in our application programming interface (API) oven, serving them up to global markets—hopefully yielding some delicious profits.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Since we’re just getting started, let’s gather our tools. We’ll use PyCharm as our IDE bowl and Interactive Brokers’ Web API as our API oven. The IDE is where we’ll write and execute our code, while the API connects us to live financial data through our brokerage account.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Now that we have our setup, let’s start with a basic recipe. We’ll mix currencies, indices, and Bitcoin with statistical momentum packages in our API bowl. Once we get the balance right, Powell’s Pies should become the top pie maker, right? Not so fast.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>The market for pies—like trading—is highly competitive. There are countless pies and pie makers, making it tough to stand out. Powell’s Pies will be up against seasoned pros who live and breathe their craft, like J Pies Morgan, MorgPies Stanley, and GoldPies Stacks.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But what if Powell’s Pies received a $100,000 investment to fuel our venture? Could we compete then? Maybe. But let’s first examine how another pie business, Samy’s Pies, stays ahead:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Samy’s Pies operates year-round, but most of its revenue comes during the holiday season. Samy capitalizes on untapped market segments by offering seasonal specialties—apple-peach pies in the spring and green apple pies before St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In algorithmic trading, a similar strategy applies. Competing with major firms requires thinking outside the box and targeting overlooked opportunities—just like running a niche pie shop. It’s all about making the most of the resources you have to capture hidden market value. Sounds like Business 101.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/the-sec-was-busy-last-week" target="_blank">Matt Levine’s Bloomberg newsletter, “The SEC Was Busy Last Week”</a>:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<ol>
							<li>Most people have 60/40 portfolios, with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.</li>
							<li>If stocks rise by 2% and bonds fall by 2%, the portfolio shifts to 61/39.</li>
							<li>To rebalance, investors sell some stocks and buy bonds.</li>
							<li>That selling pressure can push stocks down and bonds up.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Traders could exploit this pattern: “If 60/40 investors buy stocks tomorrow, I’ll buy them today and sell tomorrow when prices rise.”</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>That’s one way to profit from pies—sell directly to pie makers struggling to meet demand at month-end. Ethical? Debatable. Effective? Absolutely. But not everything in business is fair.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Matt Levine also discusses the SEC’s case against Two Sigma—a quantitative hedge fund—accused of manipulating its algorithmic models for profit.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Two Sigma researchers allegedly tricked their trading model into prioritizing their own signals, boosting performance and increasing their personal payouts.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Hedge funds pay researchers to discover trading signals—like finding the best ingredients for a pie. The IDE bowl then selects which ingredients to use, influenced by factors like the day of the week or a market-moving tweet.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Two Sigma’s model analyzed the correlation between signals. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp" target="_blank">Correlation</a> measures how assets move together. Too much correlation can make a portfolio overly concentrated—like a pie that’s too sweet to enjoy.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>By prioritizing their own signals, Two Sigma researchers inflated correlation, resulting in $400 million in excess returns but $165 million in losses for some investors. The SEC fined the firm $90 million and ordered restitution, turning a $235 million profit into a $20 million net loss. Not exactly a winning recipe.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>When designing trading strategies, too much correlation can be risky. Manipulating correlation to deceive investors? That’s a recipe for disaster.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Could Powell’s Pies become the #1 pie maker by overloading its pies with sugar? Not really. If we ignored ingredient limits and endangered our customers’ health, regulators—maybe even the PIE-SEC—would step in.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Whether baking pies or building trading models, success depends on balance, adaptability, and precision. A well-diversified portfolio—like a perfectly crafted pie—needs quality ingredients, careful measurement, and flexibility in changing conditions. Overloading on highly correlated investments can lead to poor outcomes. Instead, the key is intelligent diversification and capturing market inefficiencies—just like Samy’s seasonal pie strategy.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In our next post, we’ll explore how to optimize risk-adjusted returns using low-correlated assets and smart trading strategies. Stay tuned!</p>
