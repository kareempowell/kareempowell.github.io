							<h3></h3>
							<p>Who made the first apple pie? Where was it created? Gosh, I don’t know! But you know who might, Lauren Cabral from <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">BackThenHistory</a>. Here’s this:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>“Like apples, apple pie isn’t nearly as American as you might think. In fact, apple pie originated in Europe and it was developed with the help of multiple culinary influences, including cuisine from Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>An anonymous <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">Due South writer</a> also mentions:  “The earliest recorded recipe for apple pie dates to 1381, found in a cookbook titled The Forme of Cury, which was compiled by the master cooks of King Richard II.” </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>You mean to tell me that apple pie recipes originated from the cookbook of a king? I mean it <em>fits</em> right? Back in <em>those</em> days, sweet and savory <em>seemed only fit</em> for the rich. But who <em>really</em> cares where apple pies came from? What we do know is that this sweet and savory dish — a simple puree of apples, mixed with sugar, flour and other ingredients — is one of the most popular delicacies you’ll taste today. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Nowadays, the <em>great</em> pie makers &mdash; <a href="https://www.backthenhistory.com/articles/the-history-of-apple-pie" target="_blank">Julian Pies Company</a> and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32859-d15218532-Reviews-The_Pie_Hole-Pasadena_California.html" target="_blank">The Pies Hole</a> &mdash; provide ready-to-eat options for individuals such as myself, who can’t be bothered to bake pies from scratch. Now, I may not be the best baker, but I’m most definitely a great coder; so join me on this journey, as we create an algorithmic trading model using an apple pies approach, at the newly established <b>Powell's Pies!</b> </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Where To Start?</h2>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>To create our version of this popular <em>delicacy</em> (born from elites, and mastered only by a few) we’ll combine financial apple instruments, sugar correlation and statistical flour packages, and mix these ingredients into our integrated development environment (IDE) bowl. After, we’ll bake our mixture using our application programming interface oven to serve on the world’s markets &mdash; hopefully yielding some yummy profitable results.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Being fairly new to the business, we’ll start with what we needed to set up shop. We’ll choose Pycharm for our IDE bowl and the Interactive Brokers’ Web API for our API oven. (An IDE is where we’ll run our code, while the API is the software tool that connects us to live financial data from our brokerage &mdash; financial trading &mdash; account)</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Now that we have the necessary tools, let’s start with a basic recipe. We’ll combine currencies, indices and bitcoin ingredients with statistical flour momentum packages, mixing these together in our API bowl. Once we get the recipe correct, we’re now guaranteed to establish Powell’s Pies as the leading pie maker, right? No, not so much. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Pies markets are extremely volatile. There are tons of pies and tons of pie makers, which makes it extremely difficult to compete. Powell’s Pies will also be competing with experienced pie makers who live and die by their pies, such as J Pies Morgan, MorgPies Stanley and GoldPies Stacks.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But, let’s say Powell’s Pies received $100,000 to create our delicious creations. Could we now compete? Just maybe. But, let's look at an how another pie business, Samy’s Pies competes:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>A neighboring pie store, Samy’s Pies, sells pies throughout the year. However, the owner Samy sees most of her revenue in the holiday seasons. Samy benefits from selling holiday themed pies that exploits uncaptured segments of the larger pie market. Samy also has different methods of combining ingredients depending on  the season: she sells apple peach pies during the Spring, and green apple pies leading up to St. Patrick Day.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>When constructing algorithmic trading models a similar intuition applies. Competing with larger firms often requires an out of the box approach that capitalizes on <em>missed opportunities</em>, similar to when running a newly established pie shop &mdash; using the capital you have to profit from uncaptured market segments. Sounds like Business 101 to me! </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From <a href ="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/the-sec-was-busy-last-week" target="_blank"> Matt Levine’s Bloomberg newsletter, “The SEC Was Busy Last Week”</a> here’s this:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Most people have 60/40 portfolios, where they put 60% of their money in stocks and 40% in bonds.</li>
								<li>If stocks go up by 2% and bonds go down by 2%, then your 60/40 portfolio becomes a 61/39 portfolio.</li>
								<li>Therefore you have to sell some stocks and buy some bonds to get back to 60/40.</li>
								<li>When you sell stocks, stocks will go down; when you buy bonds, bonds will go up. …</li>
							</ol>
							<p>… If this were true, you might try to profit from it. “Whenever a 60/40 investor is going to buy stocks tomorrow, I will buy them today, and then sell them tomorrow when they go up, and vice versa,” is the basic idea.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>… You could do better — and maybe save 8 basis points — but at some cost in time and attention and internal processes, and you could also do worse. Why bother? Let someone else do it. Let some hedge fund that is set up to think about this stuff make the 8 basis points.”” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/the-sec-was-busy-last-week" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>That is certainly one way to make a profit from selling pies — sell directly to pie companies who may not have enough pies to meet demand at certain times of the month. Sounds a bit exploitative, but no not really. All’s fair in the world of business. Well, actually not. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In Matt Levine’s newsletter, he also discusses the SEC’s enforcement case against Two Sigma &mdash; a quantitative hedge fund firm &mdash; who made enormous profits <em>"allegedly deceiving"</em> some of their customers. The case goes a little something like this: </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Two Sigma Researchers <em>“allegedly”</em> tricked the company’s algorithmic trading model into prioritizing two researchers’ signals to improve the firm’s overall performance, and increase the performance payout of those individual researchers. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Hedge funds pay researchers to find trading signals &mdash; ingredients that make their pies taste better &mdash; which are then fed to an IDE bowl that determines which ingredients to use. The choice of ingredients may depend on several factors, including the day of the week <em>or</em> say if Trump made a tweet that inflated the price of the U.S. dollar at the expense of the S&P 500. In that case, the  IDE bowl may be automated to choose U.S. dollar currency ingredients, rather than S&P 500 shares.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>In Two Sigma’s case, their IDE bowl assessed the correlation between different trading signals.  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp" target="_blank">"Correlation can be described as a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other”.</a> When financial instruments are affected by similar factors, we say there is a high correlation. However, when instruments are <em>not</em> affected by similar factors, we in turn say the correlation is low. Correlation aims to extract the collective sweetness of each ingredient, allowing each to contribute <em>just marginally</em> to the overall pie’s sweetness, as too much correlation can result in an overly sweet unhealthy pie.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>To prioritize their ingredients, two Two Sigma's researchers <em>tricked</em> the model into increasing the overall portfolio correlation causing the firm's funds to overperform by more than $400 million and underperform by close to $165 million. But why is this a bad thing? Didn’t Two Sigma make an overall net profit of $235 million? Didn’t adding more sugar make the pot sweeter? Well, the pot was simply <em>too sweet!</em> While Two Sigma certainly made an overall profit, they did so at the expense of investors in investors in the losing fund &mdash; the one that underperformed by $165 million! While the pot <em>was</em> certainly sweeter, only some of their investors felt the adverse effect. In arbitrations with the SEC, Two Sigma was forced to pay $165 million to the underperforming fund, and another $90 million to the SEC to "close the case" &mdash; for a cease-and-desist order. That brings the total loss from sweetening the pot to $20 million!  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-15" target="_blank">[3]</a> Seems <em>kinda</em> bad to me.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>When creating algorithmic trading strategies, <em>too</em> much correlation <em>can</em> a bad thing. However, reducing the perceived correlation on clients' managed funds to make it seem like there is less correlation, is a really bad thing!</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>But, maybe just maybe <em>over-sweetening</em> the pot could propel Powell’s Pies to pies to the #1 Pie-Maker spot! Well actually? No, not really. If Powell’s Pies’ pies had a specified amount of sugar-per-serving but then we added a lot more sugar per serving, and adversely affected the health of our customers, we’d probably be reprimanded by some consumer regulator. Maybe, by the PIE-SEC?</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>From this example, one thing holds clear — it matters, the weighting of our algorithmic trading ingredients. Creating a portfolio with low correlated ingredients (and strategies) leads to what is called optimal risk adjusted returns. <a href="https://www.alliancebernstein.com/cmsobjectabd/pdf/investoreducation/r25281_lowcorrelation.pdf" target="_blank">[4]</a> </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>We’ll speak some more as to how we can achieve this optimal risk to return ratio in a follow up blog post. </p>
