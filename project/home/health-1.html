							<h3></h3>
							<p>The ETHAN system "uses telehealth-based consultations between 911 patients and EMS physicians, to evaluate and triage the necessity for patient transport to  a hospital emergency department." [1] The model utilizes the formulaic cost savings provided in the study and the total emergency department visits in states across the U.S. (that do not end in hospital admissions) to calculate the total provider and patient cost savings.</p>
							<h3></h3>

							<h3></h3>
							<p>Total emergency department visits were sourced from the State Emergency Department Database (SEDD) database, managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality—responsible for improving the quality of America's health-care system through access to health-related research and data.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Methodology</h2>
							<h3></h3>
							<p><b>A. Study Results: </b>The model successfully simulates the 2024 cost savings across HCUP member states in the U.S.. The referenced 2016 study [add link] uses a case-control method that compares the costs of emergency department visits of the case–telehealth evaluated EMS patients– and control groups–similar characteristic patients, who did not receive telehealth EMS interventions. (Figure 1)</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>Cost savings were realized by patients in the case group through telehealth screenings that determined whether non-urgent patients did not require visiting an emergency department. Eligible non-urgent patients were directed towards "non-ED locations using taxi based transport" rather than "more resource-intensive" ambulances.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p><b>B. Patient Savings: </b>The results of the study was a 6.7% absolute reduction in hospital ED visits and a $357,200 annual cost savings for emergency department visits. This was calculated by multiplying the reduction in study participants by the primary care emergency department costs (PCRED) for the state of Texas. Total patient state cost savings was calculated using annual state patient visits and PCRED costs per region. </p>
							<p></p>
							<p>However, due to data being unavailable for the state of Nebraska in 2021, utilized the multiseries covariate forecasting method in Python, to estimate total 2021 emergency department visits. (Figure 2)</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p><b>B(i). Multivariate time series models</b> models are often used in predicting maintenance intervals for industrial machines (such as wind turbines and energy plants, by combining sensor data, such as temperature and mechanical stress, to determine wear and tear and the approximate time till equipment failure. Eleven year emergency department visits for the 31 represented states is split between "test" (2009-12-31 to 2020-12-31) and "training" (2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31) datasets. The recursive forecasting method "LightGBM" is used to train the model to forecast 2021 visits. </p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p>Multiseries recursive forecasting is used to capture similar, underlying trends resulting from changes impacting states across the U.S., along with annual trends in each state. A lag of 1 ensures the model uses the most recent year's predicted value, as input for the following year, to capture short-term trends resulting from changes in insurance provider policies, federal healthcare spending, or health outbreaks such as Covid19. A short rolling window ensures that the model does not annually smooth out short-term fluctuations. The model yields 985,809 predicted emergency visits for Nevada in 2021. Additionally, the model's prediction interval indicates a 95% confidence that the true emergency department visits lie between 849,600 and 1,022,703. (Figure 3)</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p><b>C. Provider Savings:</b> Provider savings was calculated from the study's per visit cost savings of $103. The model then calculates the predicted cost savings across the 31 HCUP states using the real price parity index (RPP), using the state of Texas as the base. </p>
							<p></p>
							<p>The previously forecasted state Emergency Department visits are then used to calculate the total potential savings in 2021, scaling cost savings to 2024, using compounded annual healthcare inflation rates from 2021 to 2024. (Figure 4)</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p><b>D. Combined Cost Savings</b>  is simply the addition of patient and provider cost savings to represent the total annual community savings for each state (Figure 5).</p>
