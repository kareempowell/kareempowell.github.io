							<h2>Model Assumptions</h2>
							<p>When creating the model the following assumptions were made:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<ol type="A">
							<li>The formulaic percentage cost savings derived from the City of Houston’s ETHAN system would reap similar cost savings if applied across states within the U.S.</li>
							<li>The compounded annual health rate is an appropriate measure for determining 2024 patient and provider cost savings.</li>
							<li>The 2016 primary care-related Emergency Department visit (PCRED) costs for Texas — that is the average cost of being seen by a primary care provider in urban hospitals — was scaled across states using respective, state real price parities (RPP).</li>
							<li>The SEDD database comprises the total emergency department visits across 31 states, but excluding hospitals that choose not to report.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>How Do These Assumptions Impact Results?</h2>
							<ol type="A">
							<li>The formulaic cost savings from 2016 is based on urban city data in a single metropolitan city. Non-urban areas with possibly longer travel times to local emergency departments may have higher taxi and provider costs making it more expensive for triaged patients and patients in the control group. It is not abundantly clear what the net effect is — of increases in costs to both the control and telehealth group — on the study’s formulaic cost savings. It may or may not balance.</li>
							<li>The compounded annual health inflation rate might not accurately capture price increases from the studies’ inputs, such as taxi costs and programme administrative costs.</li>
							<li>Real Price Parity (RPP) is eventually scaled by health inflation rates which might not accurately capture State RPPs for future years.</li>
							<li>Total SEDD visits will be lower than total annual emergency department visits resulting in lower calculated savings.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>Data Validation</h2>
							<p>Nevada state predicted visits were validated using data obtained from the Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA) database from Nevada. CHIA visits were 999,579. Predicted visits based on the SEDD database was lower at 985,809. A conducted eye test suggests a slight underestimation of forecasted ED visits — as the SEDD database was on average 6,000 visits higher when compared with the CHIA database, over the 2017-2020 period. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10001596/#sec1-ijerph-20-04389" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
							<p>A sensitivity analysis revealed that periods with higher health inflation and real prices resulted in increased cost savings to both patients and providers.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Scalability</h2>
							<p>With similar data from similar telehealth studies the model’s results could be scaled to capture other states within the U.S. or regions in the world, provided that the following inputs are available: total emergency department visits and PCRED costs. Other data that was used to construct the model, such as real price parity (RPP) is generally widely accessible or attainable.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<h2>Model Results</h2>
							<ol>
							<li>The top two states based on % cost saved were Maine and Arizona. They both saw over 10% cost savings as a percentage of annual health and hospital savings — 16.22% for Maine ($394,989,745.66 saved from $2,680,801,077.87) and 14.73% for Arizona ($86,009,470.27 saved from $530,417,784.89).</li>
							<li>The model revealed the significance of the “health and hospital spend per capita” factor in predicting which states would see the most benefit from an ETHAN system. There seemed to be a correlation between lower health and hospital expenditure per capita and higher cost savings as a percentage of annual health and hospital spend.</li>
							<p>Are there any real-world data points you can compare your predictions against?</p>
							</ol>
							<ol type="a">
							<li>States below the $700 health and hospital spend per capita had the highest cost savings. (Figure 1)</li>

							<li> States above the $1,000 health and hospital spend per capita mark had the least cost savings, with the exceptions of Indiana and Missouri. (Figure 2)</li>
